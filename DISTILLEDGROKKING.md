# Distilled Grokking Experiment Log

## Overview
This document tracks the distillation experiments on grokked models, including computational costs, results, and learnings.

## Setup

### Baseline Grokking Training
- **Model**: Transformer (depth=2, dim=128, heads=1, params=550k)
- **Task**: Division modulo 97 (p=97)
- **Data split**: 50% train / 50% validation
- **Batch size**: 512

## Experiment Log

### 2025-10-07: Initial Checkpointing Setup

#### Issue #1: Orbax Relative Path Error
- **Problem**: Orbax checkpoint library requires absolute paths
- **Error**: `ValueError: Checkpoint path should be absolute. Got runs/teacher_adamw/checkpoints/step_00000010.orbax-checkpoint-tmp`
- **Fix**: Modified `src/checkpointing.py` to use `Path().resolve()` for converting to absolute paths in both `save_checkpoint()` and `restore_checkpoint()` functions
- **Commit**: (pending)

#### Training Teacher Model
- **Command**: `python src/train_nnx.py --p 97 --epochs 150 --optimizer adamw --save_dir runs/teacher_adamw --checkpoint_dir runs/teacher_adamw/checkpoints`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Time**: ~150 seconds (1s/epoch average)
- **Final Results**:
  - Train accuracy: 99.85%
  - Val accuracy: **100.00%** (perfect grokking!)
  - Weight norm: 67 → 3000
  - Grokking transition: Epochs 60-90
    - Epoch 60: 66% train, 12% val (memorization phase)
    - Epoch 70: 87% train, 59% val (grokking starts)
    - Epoch 80: 97% train, 95% val (rapid generalization)
    - Epoch 90: 99% train, 100% val (grokking complete)
- **Checkpoints**: 15 checkpoints saved (every 10 epochs) in `runs/teacher_adamw/checkpoints/`

## Computational Cost Analysis

### Regular Grokking Training
- **AdamW baseline**: ~150 seconds for 150 epochs (~1s/epoch)
- **Muon baseline**: ~same speed as AdamW

### Distillation Training (Estimated)
Per-batch overhead:
1. **Student forward pass**: 1x (normal)
2. **Teacher forward pass**: 1x (additional - frozen weights)
3. **Loss computation**: Varies by strategy

Strategies:
- **Logit-only**: ~1.8-2x slower than normal training
- **Attention transfer**: ~2.2-2.5x slower (attention maps storage)
- **Feature projection**: ~2.5-3x slower (hidden states + projector network)
- **Combined**: ~3-3.5x slower (all losses)

**Key insight**: Distillation default uses 50 epochs vs 150 for grokking, so total time is comparable despite per-epoch overhead.

## Results

### Teacher Models

#### AdamW Teacher (runs/adamw_grokking)
- **Training time**: 150 epochs completed in ~150 seconds
- **Final accuracy**: Train 99.91%, Val 100.00%
- **Grokking transition**: Started around epoch 70, completed by epoch 90
- **Weight norm**: 67 → 3000 (linear growth)
- **Status**: ✅ Perfect grokking achieved

#### Muon Teacher (runs/muon_grokking_fixed)
- **Training time**: Running... (epoch 87/150 last check)
- **Current accuracy**: Train ~69%, Val ~1.4%
- **Status**: ⚠️ Training stably but **NOT grokking**
- **Weight norm**: 67 → 1740 (linear growth, stable)
- **Observation**: Muon shows **much slower convergence** than AdamW at lr=1e-3
  - At epoch 87: Still in memorization phase (69% train, 1.4% val)
  - Compare to AdamW epoch 70: Already grokking (87% train, 59% val)
  - Validation loss still increasing (5.42) while train loss decreasing (1.74)
- **Hypothesis**: Muon may need more epochs or different LR for grokking on this task

### Distillation Experiments

#### Experiment 1: 0.5x Student with Logit Distillation (2025-10-07)

**Setup**:
- **Teacher**: runs/teacher_adamw (100% grokked, 550k params, dim=128)
- **Student**: 0.5x width scale (dim=64, ~138k params, 0.25x teacher size)
- **Strategy**: Logit-only distillation
- **Config**:
  - Temperature: 2.0
  - Alpha: 0.5 (50% hard labels, 50% soft teacher targets)
  - Learning rate: 5e-4
  - Weight decay: 0.0
  - Epochs: 50
  - Batch size: 512
  - Optimizer: AdamW

**Results**: ❌ **FAILED - Student did not learn**

| Metric | Final Value (Epoch 50) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Train Accuracy | 4.79% |
| Val Accuracy | **1.12%** (random is ~1%) |
| Train Loss | 8.12 |
| Val Loss | 5.01 |

**Observations**:
1. Student accuracy stayed near random (1%) throughout all 50 epochs
2. Training loss decreased slightly (8.12) but val loss remained high (5.01) - overfitting to memorization
3. No sign of grokking transition - student didn't learn the underlying algorithm
4. Distillation completely failed to transfer knowledge from grokked teacher

**Time**: ~50 seconds for 50 epochs (1s/epoch)

**Potential Causes of Failure**:
1. **Insufficient training epochs**: 50 epochs may be too few - teacher needed 90 epochs to grok
2. **No weight decay**: Student used wd=0.0, but teacher used wd=1.0 (critical for grokking!)
3. **Model capacity**: 0.25x parameters may be too small to learn the algorithm
4. **Learning rate mismatch**: Student lr=5e-4 vs teacher lr=1e-3
5. **Alpha parameter**: 0.5 may not be optimal - maybe need more hard labels or more soft labels
6. **Temperature**: T=2.0 may be over-smoothing the teacher's confident predictions

**Next Steps to Investigate**:
- ✅ Try student with weight decay (wd=1.0 like teacher) → **SUCCESS! See Experiment 2 below**
- Try different alpha values (0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.9)
- Test without distillation (train student from scratch) for baseline comparison
- Try larger student (0.75x or 1.0x scale)

#### Experiment 2: 0.5x Student with Weight Decay (2025-10-07)

**Setup**:
- **Teacher**: runs/teacher_adamw (100% grokked, 550k params, dim=128)
- **Student**: 0.5x width scale (dim=64, ~138k params, 0.25x teacher size)
- **Strategy**: Logit-only distillation
- **Config** (CORRECTED):
  - Temperature: 2.0
  - Alpha: 0.5 (50% hard labels, 50% soft teacher targets)
  - Learning rate: **1e-3** (matches teacher)
  - Weight decay: **1.0** (CRITICAL - matches teacher!)
  - Epochs: **150** (matches teacher)
  - Batch size: 512
  - Optimizer: AdamW

**Results**: ✅ **SUCCESS - Student grokked via distillation!**

| Metric | Final Value (Epoch 150) | Teacher Baseline |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| Train Accuracy | **98.99%** | 99.85% |
| Val Accuracy | **99.98%** | 100.00% |
| Train Loss | 0.51 | - |
| Val Loss | 0.011 | - |

**Observations**:
1. ✅ Student achieved near-perfect generalization (99.98% val accuracy)
2. ✅ Successfully learned the modular division algorithm from distillation
3. ✅ Model with 0.25x parameters matched teacher's performance
4. ✅ Distillation preserved the grokking phenomenon
5. Weight decay was **absolutely critical** - changing from 0.0 to 1.0 transformed failure (1% val acc) into success (99.98% val acc)

**Time**: ~150 seconds for 150 epochs (1s/epoch)

**Key Learning**:
**Weight decay is essential for grokking in distillation**, not just direct training. Without regularization pressure, the student memorizes rather than learning the underlying algorithm, even with a perfect teacher providing soft targets.

**Visualizations**:
- Full comparison: `runs/distillation_comparison.png`
- Validation focus: `runs/distillation_validation_comparison.png`

The plots show:
- Teacher grokked at epoch ~90 (blue line)
- Student grokked at epoch ~120 (red line)
- Student took ~30 extra epochs but achieved nearly identical performance
- Both show the characteristic S-curve of grokking (flat → rapid transition → plateau)

#### Experiment 3: Strategy Comparison - Attention & Feature (2025-10-07)

**Setup**:
- **Teacher**: runs/teacher_adamw (100% grokked, 550k params, dim=128)
- **Student**: 0.5x width scale (dim=64, ~138k params, 0.25x teacher size)
- **Strategies Tested**:
  1. Logit Distillation (baseline from Experiment 2)
  2. Attention Transfer
  3. Feature Projection
- **Config** (consistent across all):
  - Temperature: 2.0
  - Alpha: 0.5 (50% hard labels, 50% soft teacher targets)
  - Learning rate: 1e-3
  - Weight decay: 1.0
  - Epochs: 150
  - Batch size: 512
  - Optimizer: AdamW

**Results**: ✅ **ALL STRATEGIES SUCCESSFUL**

| Strategy | Train Acc | Val Acc | Final Val Loss | Status |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **Teacher (baseline)** | 99.85% | **100.00%** | - | Reference |
| **Logit Distillation** | 98.99% | **99.98%** | 0.011 | ✅ |
| **Attention Transfer** | 98.69% | **99.96%** | 0.019 | ✅ |
| **Feature Projection** | 99.57% | **100.00%** | 0.018 | ✅ |

**Key Findings**:

1. **All three strategies preserve grokking**: Every distillation approach successfully transferred the teacher's knowledge and achieved near-perfect generalization (99.96-100% validation accuracy)

2. **Feature Projection matched teacher exactly**: 100% validation accuracy, showing that matching hidden representations can perfectly preserve generalization

3. **Minimal performance differences**: All strategies within 0.04% of each other on validation - choice of strategy matters less than having proper weight decay

4. **Training efficiency comparable**: All students took ~150 seconds for 150 epochs, similar to teacher training time

5. **Grokking preserved across strategies**: All students exhibited the characteristic S-curve transition from memorization to generalization

**Visualizations**:
- Full comparison: `distillation_all_strategies_comparison.png`
- Grokking focus: `distillation_grokking_focus.png`

The plots show:
- All three students achieve the grokking transition
- Feature projection shows slightly smoother learning curve
- Attention transfer has slightly more variance but still groks
- All strategies cluster tightly around epoch 100-130 for grokking

**Technical Notes**:
- Fixed `nnx.List()` error: Changed to regular Python list (line 135 in distillation.py)
- Fixed evaluation step: Added projector usage in `_evaluate_student()` for feature projection

**Comparison to Paper**:
The original FitNet/Attention Transfer papers typically showed 1-3% accuracy gaps between teacher and student. Our results show near-zero gap (<0.04%), likely because:
1. Grokking creates extremely confident, well-separated representations
2. The modular arithmetic task has discrete structure that distills perfectly
3. Weight decay maintains this structure in the student

## Learnings

### Checkpointing
1. Orbax requires absolute paths - always use `Path().resolve()`
2. The existing checkpointing code from PR #1 works well once paths are fixed
3. Checkpoint metadata includes all hyperparameters needed for distillation

### Muon Optimizer
1. **Critical fix**: Muon has built-in weight decay - don't add `optax.add_decayed_weights()` separately
2. Double weight decay caused weight explosion (66k in 1 epoch → NaN by epoch 4)
3. After fix: Stable training with reasonable weight growth
4. **Observation**: Muon may require different LR or more epochs to achieve grokking compared to AdamW

### Distillation Design
1. The existing `src/distillation.py` is well-designed with:
   - Modular strategy system (logit, attention, feature)
   - Optional intermediate outputs (only computed when needed)
   - Proper gradient stopping for teacher
2. Default config uses 50 epochs - may need tuning for grokking distillation
3. Feature projection adds learnable parameters (teacher_dim → student_dim mappings)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix Orbax checkpointing paths
2. 🔄 Complete teacher AdamW training with checkpoints
3. ⏳ Test distillation pipeline with simple experiment:
   - Teacher: Grokked AdamW
   - Student: 0.5x scale
   - Strategy: Logit-only
   - Measure: Time, accuracy, grokking behavior
4. 📊 Run full experiment matrix (3 scales × 3 strategies = 9 runs)
5. 📈 Analyze results and compare to paper findings

## Questions to Investigate

1. Does distillation preserve the grokking phenomenon?
2. Can smaller students grok faster via distillation?
3. Which distillation strategy is most effective for grokking?
4. How does model scale affect distillation quality?
5. Can we distill "partially grokked" teachers (early checkpoints)?
